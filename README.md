## What is this?

#### So this is an experiments.

I read [article](https://kevinsmith.io/modern-php-without-a-framework/) written by [Kevin Smith](kevinsmith.io), about modern PHP without framework. <br />
Maybe its not create PHP without framework, but rather you build your own. Its sure is fun! <br />
And also thanks to [build-your-own-x]() that I can found it.

#### Give it a try!
